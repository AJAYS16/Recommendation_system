# Collaborative Recommendation System

# This code implements a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system
# that predicts user preferences based on the behavior of similar users.

# Steps Involved:

# 1. Data Collection: 
#    - User-item interaction data is collected (e.g., user ratings, purchase history).

# 2. Data Preprocessing:
#    - The data is cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for the recommendation algorithm.

# 3. Similarity Calculation:
#    - User-based or item-based collaborative filtering is applied.
#    - Similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation are used to find similar users or items.

# 4. Prediction:
#    - The system predicts a user's rating for an item by aggregating the preferences of similar users or items.

# 5. Recommendation:
#    - Based on the predictions, the system generates a list of recommended items for the user.

# The code includes the implementation of various algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
# to enhance the accuracy of the recommendations.

# Example usage and evaluation metrics are also provided to validate the performance of the model.
